# ðŸŽµ MusicPlayer

A code challenge developed for Music.AI as part of the hiring process.<br/> 
This app allows users to search for songs through the Apple iTunes API and play previews in a clean, responsive interface.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The project was built following the given requirements:

âœ… Usage of Swift 6<br/>
âœ… MVVM architecture pattern<br/>
âœ… Tests implementation<br/>
âœ… API results pagination

Additionally, some optional features were implemented (see Extra Features).

## ðŸ“± Screens & Features
* Splash Screen
* Songs Screen (Home) with search and pagination
* Song Details (Player) with mini-player integration
* More Options Menu
* Album Screen

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repository
1. Open the project in Xcode 16+
1. Run on a simulator or a physical device with iOS 18+

No additional dependencies are required

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Differences
While the core design was followed, some adjustments were made for usability and technical feasibility:

* The mini-player was added for smoother user experience
* The `More Options` screen was turned into a menu, `Song Details` into the expandable mini-player, and `Album` into a navigation stack screen. These changes improved the user experience and addressed some technical challenges (see Challenges & Solutions).
* Some spacing, font sizes, and UI details were adapted to fit Appleâ€™s Human Interface Guidelines

My initial idea was to create two branches, one with the expected design and another with the mini-player, but due to lack of time that was not possible.

## ðŸ“š References & Inspiration
To implement certain parts of the app, I drew inspiration from external resources:

- Mini-player adapted from a YouTube tutorial by Kavsoft -

## ðŸ›  Challenges & Solutions
During development, I faced some challenges:

### API Limitations:

The iTunes Search API isn't consistent with the documentation.

### Album Screen:

- On the `lookup` request `limit` and `offset` don't work, also, even while sending the `entity` parameter as `song` and `media` as `music`, on some albums some music videos are present, something that could impose problems as they don't always have a preview URL.

âœ… **Solution**: When looking up some albums where lookup request returns a music video like Panic! At the Disco - Pretty. Odd. (Deluxe Version), where the last song, Mad As Rabbits, does not have a preview URL, the song is not selectable on the album Screen and not present on the playlist while the album songs are playing.

### Pagination Handling:

- On the documentation, the `offset` parameter used for pagination is not mentioned. It doesn't seem reliable as well, using it for pagination sometimes results in duplicated songs.
- The `limit` parameter seems to only work as intended on really small values (1-3). When using other values, the API can return more than the chosen limit.

âœ… **Solution**: Instead of relying on the consistency of the `limit` property value, the next page requests keep being made after the user scrolls to the bottom while the request returns results, only being stopped when a request returns 0 results.

### Mini-player Behavior

- When the mini-player is present, opening the keyboard or a bottom sheet overlapped the mini-player, making it a bad user experience.

âœ… **Solution**: Added a notification observer for when the keyboard is opened and closed, so the windowLevel property of the mini-player can decrease while the keyboard is open, and then go back to the expected level after the keyboard is dismissed.

This was also my first experience with Appleâ€™s Testing framework, which required me to quickly adapt and learn its differences compared to traditional XCTest unit tests.

## âž• Extra Features
- Error/States handling
- Swipe to refresh
- Swift concurrency
- Repository organization
- Dark and light mode design
- On the player screen:
	- Forward/Backward actions
	- Slider action to seek a specific position
	- Shuffle and Repeat options

## ðŸ”® If I Had More Time
With additional time, I would have liked to implement:

- Increase song streaming speed while pressing the forward button, and reverse the song while pressing the backwards button
- Create more unit tests
- Offline caching for recently played tracks
- UI tests with XCTest and snapshot testing
- More detailed error handling with retry mechanisms
- Create playlists
- Share songs with deeplinks
- Create a tab for looking at a favorite songs list

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Swift 6
- SwiftUI
- Combine / Concurrency (async/await)
- Swift Testing for Unit Testing

Thanks for taking the time to review this project!  
Iâ€™d be happy to discuss the implementation details and decisions further.
